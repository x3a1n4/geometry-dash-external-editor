# gdee

**About**
GDEE (for "Geometry Dash External Editor") is a project to build a seperate level-editor for the game "Geometry Dash".

**Libraries**
+ Python 3.11
+ Dear ImGui
+ OpenGL (?)

**Build Info (IMPORTANT):**
Change "toolchainFile" in CMakePresets.json to your vcpkg installation. I'll change this later, I just didn't feel like dealing with environment variables
